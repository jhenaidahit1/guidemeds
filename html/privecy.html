                <h4>Law enforcement</h4>
                <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required

                    commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute
                    security.</p>

                    that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of
                    parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.</p>
                <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country
                    requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that
                    information.</p>
